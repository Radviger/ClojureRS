/The repl in action/

** Project Goals:
  1. To create a version of Clojure that gets to exist independent of a particular platform  
  2. To explore a Clojure that, being more independent, has
     a. Proper tail call elimination 
     b. Conditions / Restarts 
     c. Any other feature it might not normally be able to indulge 
  3. To, should the project progress,  begin looking more serious into advanced compilation techniques,
     to create a serious Clojure implementation 

     Check clojureRS.org (the file, not website) for more notes about
     the design of the language, which should grow as the program
     grows.
